Lifestyle factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and unhealthy diet have been linked to increased risk of hypertension.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends that adults should measure their blood pressure at least once a year and consult with a healthcare provider if their blood pressure levels are consistently above normal.

The diagnosis is made by the gradual onset of these symptoms, as well as the presence of a thickened pericardium on physical examination. The differential diagnosis includes cardiac tamponade, right ventricular infarction, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and cirrhosis with ascites. Treatment involves gentle diuresis and surgical stripping of the pericardium. Evaluation for tuberculosis is also necessary.\n\nTreatment for constrictive pericarditis typically involves gentle diuresis and surgical stripping of the pericardium. The goal is to remove the excess fluid and restore the normal function of the pericardium. The diuresis is done through the use of medications such as diuretics, which help to remove excess fluid from the body. The surgical stripping of the pericardium is done through a procedure called pericardiocentesis, which involves removing the pericardium and the fluid it contains. The pericardium is then removed and the heart is allowed to rest for a few days to allow the pericardium to heal.\n\nIn some cases, the condition may require surgical intervention, such as a pericardiocentesis or a heart-lung transplant. In these cases, the patient may require hospitalization and intensive care. The prognosis for constrictive pericarditis is generally good, but the condition can be life-threatening if left untreated."

        "content": "Constrictive pericarditis is a rare condition characterized by the narrowing of the pericardial sac, which is the sac that surrounds the heart. The pericardium is a sac-like membrane that covers the heart and is attached to the heart's walls. In constrictive pericarditis, the pericardium becomes inflamed and thickened, causing it to become constricted, which can lead to the narrowing of the pericardial sac. This condition can cause symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. It is a rare condition that affects only a small number of people worldwide."
